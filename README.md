# PythonScripts
## What is this project?
This project is consists of scripts that I have always needed to use for my daily life. These scripts can be used by anybody and is intended to be generally useful for everyone.

## What kind of scripts have I made?
1. File Sorter: Provide a folder path into the application, and it will sort out all the files and place them into its respective folder (eg: all word documents is moved into a words folder). The new folders that are created are made in the path the user provided.
2. Removing an images background: When making GUI's, many programmers will want to use images in their applications. If they find these images from online, they sometimes are not downloaded with a transparent background. This application will allow users to make their images background transparent.
3. Sharpening an image: This is an useful script that allows us to quickly enhance a set of images automatically.
