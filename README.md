## What is this project?
This project is consists of scripts that I have always needed to use for my daily life. These scripts can be used by anybody and is intended to be generally useful for everyone.

## What kind of scripts have I made?
1. File Sorter: Provide a folder path into the application, and it will sort out all the files and place them into its respective folder (eg: all word documents is moved into a words folder). The new folders that are created are made in the path the user provided.

## What are the plans for furture versions?
1. Soon I wish to implement a script that converts all word files in a folder to pdfs and vice versa.
2. Soon I wish to implement a script that allows you to make images transparent so they can be used in GUI's

## What have I learnt while making this project?
1. I have learnt how to open folders provided the correct folder path.
2. I have learnt how to move files into different folders.
3. I have learnt how to create new folders and ensure no duplicate folders are made.
4. I have learnt how to use the os module such as how to use the os.path.join method and the os.makedirs method.
5. I have gained better debugging experience and documentation experience.
